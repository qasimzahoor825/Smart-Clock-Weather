# Smart-Clock-Weather
This project is a Smart Clock Weather UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time and date with automatic day/night themes. Users can search any city to view real-time weather and a 3-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API, plus a “Speak Time” feature with speech synthesis.
